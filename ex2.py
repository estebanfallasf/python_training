# A comment, this is so you can read your program later. 
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
print "This will run."
# Adding another few lines just for fun.
print 'Q: Why does the "#" in "print "Hi # there." not get ignored?'
# print 'The # in that code is inside a string, so it will put into the string until the ending " character is hit. These pound characters are just considered characters and are not considered comments.'
# Another way to put it: (aren't instead of "are not")
print "The # in that code is inside a string, so it will put into the string until the ending \" character is hit. These pound characters are just considered characters and aren't considered comments."
# The backslash will escape the special character, as seen on the code above. Isaac Albeniz - Asturias :-)
